        <h3>Albany, NY</h3>
        <p>The mascot I made is <b style="color:Red">Albany Apes</b>. </p>
        <p>My lastname is Adhikari, so the first city I found with A is Albany. And the I found
            the  name Albany little hillarious so I think Apes goes good with it. And my first name
            is Reason that made be color the mascot in Red.
            Some fun facts about the mascot are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Albany Apes are funny!</li>
            <li>Albany Apes are intelligent</li>
            <li>Albany Apes rock.</li>
        </ul>
